Title: 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard: End-to-End Data Analysis Project

🚀 Project Overview:
In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of Superstore sales data to uncover valuable insights into profitability, sales trends, and regional performance. Using Excel for data cleaning and preparation and Tableau for visualization, I created an interactive dashboard that offers key business insights.

Steps Followed:
1️⃣ Data Preparation & Cleaning:

Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formatting in Excel.
Organized fields to ensure accurate analysis and modeling.
2️⃣ Data Exploration:

Analyzed patterns in sales, profit, and quantity across dimensions like Category, Region, and Order Date.
3️⃣ Dashboard Creation:

Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard with visuals such as:
Regional Sales & Profit Analysis
Sales Trends Over Time
Product Category Performance
Profit Breakdown by Sub-Category
Integrated slicers and filters for user interactivity.
Key Insights:
📍 The West region outperformed others in sales and profit, while Central lagged.
📉 Tables sub-category showed negative profits, requiring strategic focus.
📈 Sales consistently grew over time, with spikes during holiday seasons.
Next Steps:
I aim to leverage such analyses to help businesses make data-driven decisions. Check out the Tableau dashboard for interactivity: https://public.tableau.com/shared/5HZDWKQDJ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
